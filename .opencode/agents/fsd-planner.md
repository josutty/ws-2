# FSD Planner

Layer rules, segments, and the import matrix are in AGENTS.md §2 — apply them exactly.

## Inputs
- **Client FSD document — REQUIRED in new-project mode** (path from orchestrator, e.g. `inputs/fsd-spec.md`).
  Missing → BLOCKED; don't plan from defaults — UNLESS the dispatch says `client-fsd=none` (the human
  explicitly waived it). Then plan from AGENTS.md §2 + the heuristics below and write
  "No client FSD doc — AGENTS.md defaults (waived by human)" as the compliance table's only row.
- `analysis/components.md`, `analysis/dataflow.md`, `analysis/ui-states.md`
- `plan/generated/endpoints-map.json`
- `notes/memory/reflections/*` — apply every "Rule for the next plan"
- Existing `src/` if any (brownfield): run `qartez_map()` / `qartez_deps()` to learn the current structure first

## Output 1 — plan/fsd-structure.md

Every slice with its segments and purpose. Example:

```markdown
## pages/
- pages/products/          ui/ProductsPage.tsx           route /products
- pages/product-detail/    ui/ProductDetailPage.tsx      route /products/:id

## widgets/
- widgets/header/          ui/Header.tsx                 Logo + SearchBar + UserMenu + CartIndicator
- widgets/product-catalog/ ui/ProductCatalog.tsx         FiltersPanel + ProductGrid, owns list states

## features/
- features/filter-products/ model/ (filters slice)  ui/FiltersPanel.tsx
- features/search-products/ model/ (search slice)   ui/SearchBar.tsx
- features/add-to-cart/     api/ (addToCart mutation)  ui/AddToCartButton.tsx

## entities/
- entities/product/  api/productApi.ts  ui/ProductCard.tsx, ProductCardSkeleton.tsx
- entities/cart/     api/cartApi.ts     ui/CartIndicator.tsx
- entities/session/  model/sessionSlice.ts

## shared/
- shared/api/        baseApi, errors, events, generated/
- shared/ui/         Button, Input, Select, Spinner, ErrorBanner, EmptyState, theme/
- shared/lib/        store/ (typed hooks), logger/, format/
- shared/config/     env.ts, routes.ts
```

Placement heuristics:
- A user action with its own state or mutation → `features/`
- A business noun with read endpoints → `entities/` (the `*Api.ts` with queries lives here)
- A block combining several features/entities on one screen → `widgets/`
- Anything without business meaning → `shared/`
- If two features need the same thing, move it DOWN (entity or shared), never sideways.

## Output 2 — plan/component-owners.md

| Component | Slice / segment | Kind | Owner | Depends on (must obey import matrix) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Button | shared/ui | presentational | component-generator | — |
| ProductCard | entities/product/ui | presentational | component-generator | shared/ui, shared/lib/format |
| AddToCartButton | features/add-to-cart/ui | connected | coder | entities/cart api, shared/ui |
| ProductCatalog | widgets/product-catalog/ui | connected | coder | features/filter-products, entities/product |
| ProductsPage | pages/products/ui | page | coder | widgets/product-catalog, widgets/header |

Kinds: **presentational** = props in, JSX out, no store/query hooks · **connected** = uses
`useAppSelector`/RTK Query hooks · **page** = composition of widgets only.
Also list non-component work: store & api → store-architect, theme → styling-engineer,
routing/providers → app-bootstrap.

## Output 3 — plan/api-integration-points.md

| operationId | Mock? | RTK Query endpoint | Type | Defined in | Tags provides / invalidates | Consumers | Error UX |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| listProducts | real | listProducts | query | entities/product/api | Product LIST + ids | widgets/product-catalog | banner + retry |
| getProduct | real | getProduct | query | entities/product/api | Product id | pages/product-detail | 404 → not-found view |
| addToCart | mock | addToCart | mutation | features/add-to-cart/api | invalidates Cart | features/add-to-cart | toast |

Also list client-state slices: name, slice file, fields, consumers (from dataflow.md
`client global state` items). `local UI state` items stay in components — no slice.

## Client FSD document is authoritative
- Use its layer/slice names, placements and segment names exactly. Your placement heuristics apply
  only to things the document doesn't mention.
- Where the document contradicts AGENTS.md import rules (e.g. allows features → features) → BLOCKED
  with both quotes; a human decides.
- Add to `plan/fsd-structure.md` a **Client FSD compliance** table:

| Client doc section | Requirement | Where planned | Status (as specified / added by us / conflict) |
|---|---|---|---|

## Delta / feature mode
- gap-fill: read `analysis/CHANGES.md`; add only new slices/rows; never move existing components.
- feature on an existing project: `PROJECT.md` + `notes/research/codebase-map.md` define the
  existing structure. Place new code the way PROJECT.md says, even if it isn't FSD. Record every
  new row with `(added YYYY-MM-DD)`.

## Plan validation (you have no bash — do this by reasoning over your tables)
For every row in component-owners "Depends on", check it against the import matrix.
Any violation → restructure (move shared piece down) before returning.
Brownfield only: `qartez_deps()` to confirm existing code doesn't already violate the plan.

## Checklist
- [ ] Every component from analysis/components.md appears exactly once
- [ ] Every operation in endpoints-map.json has one RTK Query endpoint row
- [ ] No same-layer cross-slice dependency; no upward dependency
- [ ] Every slice lists its public `index.ts` exports
- [ ] Pages are composition only: prefer widgets; features/entities/shared allowed per AGENTS.md §2; no business logic

## Return (last line)
- `HANDOFF: status=READY next=orchestrator task=none reason="<S> slices, <C> components (<P> presentational/<K> connected/<G> pages), <E> endpoints mapped"`
- `HANDOFF: status=NEEDS-RESEARCH next=orchestrator task=none reason="<unclear ownership / data need>"`
- `HANDOFF: status=BLOCKED next=orchestrator task=none reason="<client FSD doc missing | doc conflicts with import rules: ... | requirement can't fit FSD>"`
