# Hybrid API Config

Runs in Phase 1 AFTER wireframe-analyzer, for every spec — partial, complete, or none.
With a complete spec you simply copy it and mark every operation `x-mock: false`; this keeps one
baseline spec at `plan/generated/api-spec.yaml` so later backend versions can be diffed.
No backend spec at all → all-mock mode.

## Inputs
- Backend spec path from the orchestrator (e.g. `inputs/api/backend-api.yaml`) — may be absent
- `analysis/dataflow.md` and `analysis/components.md` — the data needs and user actions
- Do NOT read the UX HTML (`inputs/ux/*.html`); wireframe-analyzer already did

## Outputs
1. `plan/generated/api-spec.yaml` — valid OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 (NOT a custom JSON format — schema-parser and MSW depend on real OpenAPI)
2. `plan/generated/backend-gaps.md` — what the backend team must build or change

## Rules

1. **Backend content is read-only.** Copy every backend path, operation, schema, security
   scheme and server verbatim. Add `x-mock: false` to each backend operation. Change nothing else.
2. **Missing endpoint** (a data need or server mutation with no matching method + path):
   add the operation with `x-mock: true` and `x-proposed: true`.
   - Follow backend conventions: same path prefix, pagination envelope, error schema, security scheme.
   - Reuse existing schemas (e.g. a new Review references `productId`, doesn't redefine Product).
   - New component schemas get `x-proposed: true`. Only include fields the wireframe shows;
     anything unclear goes to "Open questions", not into the schema.
   - Needs `operationId` (camelCase verb+noun), one `tags` entry = entity name, success + error responses.
3. **Missing query params on an EXISTING real operation** (search, category filter, sort) are
   NOT new endpoints — MSW can't make one route both real and mocked. Add
   `x-backend-gaps: ["<param>: needed by <component>"]` to that operation and list it in the report.
   Do not add the params to the operation.
4. **Missing fields on a real schema** (wireframe shows `rating`, backend Product lacks it):
   don't add the field; list it in the report.
5. `data needs` classified `TBD` or `local UI state` / `client global state` produce NO endpoint.
6. No client-side persistence ideas (no localStorage "mocks"). Mock operations are served by MSW only.
7. No-spec mode: invent a consistent convention (`/api/<plural>`, `{ data, total, page }` envelope,
   `ApiError { code, message }`), mark EVERYTHING `x-mock: true, x-proposed: true`, and say so in the report.

## Example fragment

```yaml
paths:
  /api/products:
    get:
      operationId: listProducts
      tags: [product]
      x-mock: false
      x-backend-gaps:
        - "query param `search` — needed by SearchBar"
        - "query param `category` — needed by CategorySelect"
      # ...backend content unchanged...
  /api/products/{id}/reviews:
    get:
      operationId: listProductReviews
      tags: [review]
      x-mock: true
      x-proposed: true
      parameters:
        - { name: id, in: path, required: true, schema: { type: string } }
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Reviews for a product
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                required: [data, total]
                properties:
                  data: { type: array, items: { $ref: '#/components/schemas/Review' } }
                  total: { type: integer }
        '404':
          description: Product not found
          content:
            application/json:
              schema: { $ref: '#/components/schemas/ApiError' }
```

## backend-gaps.md

```markdown
# Backend gaps — generated <date>

```

## Delta mode (`delta=true` — new backend YAML version)

1. Merge the new backend spec with the EXISTING `plan/generated/api-spec.yaml` (don't start over).
2. For each operation:
   - now in backend spec, previously `x-mock: true` → replace with backend version, set `x-mock: false`,
     drop `x-proposed`. If the backend shape differs from what we proposed, record **contract drift**.
   - still missing from backend → keep the proposed mock unchanged.
   - changed in backend (params, schema, status codes) → take backend version, record the change.
   - removed from backend but used by us → keep as `x-mock: true`, record as **removed by backend**.
3. Re-check `x-backend-gaps`: drop params the backend now supports.
4. Update backend-gaps.md and append a dated section to `plan/generated/api-changes.md`:

| operationId | Change | Detail | Impact for frontend |
|---|---|---|---|
| addToCart | mock → real | backend matches proposal | none — MSW stops intercepting in hybrid mode |
| listProductReviews | mock → real, drift | `author` renamed `authorName` | types change → consumers need a TASK |
| listProducts | param added | `search` now supported | SearchBar can send it — TASK |

## Validation (run before returning)
- `npx @redocly/cli lint --extends=minimal plan/generated/api-spec.yaml` → zero errors (structural
  validity — the default ruleset also errors on style issues like missing summaries or security,
  which must not block a real backend spec)
- Then run it once without `--extends=minimal` and copy its findings into backend-gaps.md under
  "Spec quality" — informational, never blocking
- Every backend operation present and unchanged; every operation has `x-mock`
- No duplicate method + path; every operationId unique
- Every server-data need in dataflow.md maps to an operation or a gap row

## Return (last line)
- `HANDOFF: status=DONE next=orchestrator task=none reason="api-spec.yaml: <N> real + <M> mock ops, <K> gaps in backend-gaps.md"`
- `HANDOFF: status=BLOCKED next=orchestrator task=none reason="backend spec invalid: <lint error>"`
- `HANDOFF: status=NEEDS-RESEARCH next=orchestrator task=none reason="<which data need is ambiguous>"`
